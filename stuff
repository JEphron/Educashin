Until college, I lacked motivation. I know that many of my peers suffered similarly.

We built an app which makes it easy for parents to incentivize their children to learn by automatically monitoring their learning on khan academy and depositing money into their virtual piggybank as a reward for positive progress

To encourage the students to become citizens within their community, they donate a portion of savings to their chosen charity.

In the process of achieving an phillantropic as well as a monitary goal, the students develop integrity that they will then further apply in the real world.

The parent signs in with venmo

Their dashboard shows their child's progress in current courses and the history of their participation. 

As a parent, I enter my child's venmo details, and link up with their Khan Academy account 

[switch to khan tab]

Now, from the child's perspective, I show what happens when I finish a video

With the help of pusher, a notification appears on screen. We use Twilio to text the student with a congratz. (show watch)

Now it is a simple matter for the student to click this link (click) and they're taken to their dashboard, where they can see their progress towards their goal. Here they choose their charity and claim their part of the prize. Half the money goes to their venmo account, and half to their chosen cause.
