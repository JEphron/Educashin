Educashin is a web-application which enables children to learn, give back to their community, and get hands on experience with financial responsibility. 
Our application does this by providing cash incentives to complete exercises on Khan Academy. The students are encouraged to give back by donating some of their earnings to local charities. We give the parent the ability to guide their child's education, encourage strong work ethic, and instill a sense of community that will lead them down the path to global citizenship.
